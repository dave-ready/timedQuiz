# timedQuiz
     This is all I have so far.  Sorry it's so late, I'm having a really hard time with this assignment.  Hopefully, I'll be able to resubmit for a re-grade.  I realize my coding may seem confusing, but I think may finally be on the right track. Please note, I created the quiz.html file as a way to write out my questions and create my html "skeleton" -  it's there for my reference and is not meant to have any css or javascript linked to it.  The index.html file is where I link my CSS and JS. 
     like I said, I've been having a hard time with this assignment, but I think I might finally be on the right track.  I just wanted to submit something at this point.  ALSO, I still need to resubmit my pasword homework as well, thank you for allowing me to do so!  Should I work on that first? Fortunately, my job is allowing me to cut back on days, so I should have a lot more time to focus on my coding starting next week.  Sorry for all these delays!
